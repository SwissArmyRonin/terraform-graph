# terraform-graph

Graph module dependencies to GML files.

## Installation

Install [hcl2json](https://github.com/abiosoft/hcl2json).

Next, run:
```shell
npm i
npm run build
npm link
```

Now `terraform-graph` should be available in your `PATH`.

## Usage

Simple usage:

```bash
terraform-graph example/terraform-aws-eks > example/sample.gml
```

_To use the example, make sure to checkout the sub-module first with `git submodule update --init`_

Use something [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) to open and organize the resulting graph.

Example:

- Open the GML file
- Click "Tools->Fit Node to Label" (uncheck all the check boxes)
- Click "Layout->One-Click Layout"
- Enjoy!

`terraform-graph` supports a number of switches to improve results. Try running the example above with:

```bash
cd example/terraform-aws-eks
terraform init
terraform-graph -mjp > example/sample.gml
```

This will try to filter out irrelevant information, and will include data from external modules (requires `terraform init`).
